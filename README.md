# TRF-MASH

This is the code for the analysis of phenotypic, microbial (16S), and untargeted metabolomics changes in streptozotocin + high-fat diet (STAM/HFD) mice subjected to time-restricted feeding (TRF). The goal was to determine if this intervention can ameliorate the development of dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). The phenotypic results are published and in the `JBR_2025` folder.

## Instructions on Data Access

### Mouse

16S microbiome data is available in Qiita [https://qiita.ucsd.edu] under the study ID 13785. Untargeted metabolomics data is available in the MassIVE database [https://massive.ucsd.edu/] under the MassIVE ID MSV000088063. Feature based molecular networking data is available on [GNPS](https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/status.jsp?task=f41b3349635c4db3951083ad68727fc2).

### Human

We used the [Caussy & Tripathy, et al. 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09455-9) twin MAFLD cohort 16S microbiome and untargeted metabolomics data for validation. 16S microbiome data is available in Qiita [https://qiita.ucsd.edu] under the study ID 11635. Untargeted metabolomics data is available in the MassIVE database [https://massive.ucsd.edu/] under the MassIVE ID MSV000082374. Feature based molecular networking data is available on [GNPS](https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/status.jsp?task=778cfcb06dec4af3bf8bc8c50bb388dc).
